Acts as Importable
==================

Originally written for Rails 2 / Ruby 1.8 by [Tim Riley](https://github.com/timriley).  
Updated to Rails 3 by [Joe Martinez](https://github.com/capitalist).  
Updated to Ruby 1.9.2 by [Pranas Kiziela](https://github.com/Pranas).  
Coverage improved and additional hooks added by [Brandon Valentine](https://github.com/brandonvalentine).  
Updated to Rails 3.2.1 because write_inheritable_attribute replaced with class_attribute by [Keith Weightman](https://github.com/kweightman).

Taste's good with Joe Martinez' [model_mill](https://rubygems.org/gems/model_mill/) gem.

[Importing Legacy Data in Rails](http://openmonkey.com/articles/2009/05/importing-legacy-data-in-rails) is currently the best source of documentation.

I (Brandon) have added a before_import hook, as well as before_import and after_import methods that can be defined on the legacy class.  If defined, the class methods are called before and after import_all and import_all_in_batches.  The instance method after_import is passed the new model object, and the class method after_import is passed an array of new model objects if and only if it's called from import_all.  import_all_in_batches is designed to save memory with large data sets, and thus passing the entire set of new model objects would defeat this goal.

This stuff is still a bit rough, but the specs pass, the coverage is much improved, and I can move on and use this in production.

TODO:

Refactor to use AR-style hooks, rather than relying on specially named methods.  That's a lame-o approach.
